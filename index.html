  <p>
      "I’m a modern man, a man for the millennium, digital and smoke-free, a
      diversified multi-cultural post-modern deconstructionist, politically,
      anatomically, and ecologically incorrect.
  </p>
  <p>
      I’ve been uplinked and downloaded, I’ve been inputted and outsourced,
      I know the upside of downsizing, I know the downside of upgrading.
      I’m a high-tech lowlife, a state-of-the-art bi-coastal multitasker,
      and I can give you a gigabyte in a nanosecond.
  </p>
  <p>
      I’m new wave, but I’m old school, and my inner child is outward bound.
      I’m a hot-wired, heat-seeking, warm-hearted cool customer, voice-activated
      and biodegradable. I interface with my database, and my database is in
      cyberspace, so I’m interactive, I’m hyperactive, and from time to time,
      I’m radioactive.
  </p>
  <p>
      Behind the 8-ball, ahead of the curve, riding the wave, dodging the bullet,
      pushing the envelope. I’m on point, on task, on message, and off drugs.
      I got no need for coke and speed. I have no urge to binge and purge. I’m in
      the moment, on the edge, over the top, but under the radar. A high-concept,
      low-profile, medium-range ballistics missionary. A street-wise smart bomb,
      a top-gun bottom-feeder.
  </p>
  <p>
      I have power eyes, I tell power lies, I take power naps, I run victory laps.
      I’m a totally ongoing bigfoot slam dunk rainmaker with a proactive outreach.
      A raging workaholic, a working rageaholic. I got a personal trainer, a
      personal shopper, a personal assistant, and a personal agenda. You can’t
      shut me up, you can’t dumb me down, ’cause I’m tireless, and I’m wireless.
      I’m an alpha male on beta blockers.
  </p>
  <p>
      I’m a non-believer and an overachiever, laid back, but fashion forward, up
      front, down home, low rent, high maintenance; super-size, long lasting,
      high definition, fast acting, oven ready, and built to last. I’m a
      hands-on, footloose, kneejerk head case, prematurely post-traumatic.
  </p>
  <p>
      But I’m feeling, I’m caring, I’m healing, I’m sharing, a supportive,
      bonding, nurturing. My output is down, but my income is up. I take a short
      position on a long bond, and my revenue stream has its own cash flow. I
      read junk mail, I eat junk food, I buy junk bonds, I watch trash sports.
      I’m gender specific, capital intensive, user friendly, and lactose
      intolerant.
  </p>
  <p>
      I’m toll free, bite size, ready to wear, and I come in all sizes. A fully
      equipped, factory authorized, hospital tested, clinically proven,
      scientifically formulated medical miracle. I’ve been prewashed, precooked,
      preheated, prescreened, preapproved, postdated, freeze dried, double
      wrapped, vacuum packed, and I have an unlimited broadband capacity. I’m a
      rude dude, but I’m the real deal, lean and mean, cocked, locked, and ready
      to rock; rough, tough, and hard to bluff. I take it slow, I go with the
      flow, I ride with the tide, I got glide in my stride. Drivin’ and movin’,
      sailin’ and spinin’, jivin’ and groovin’, wailin’ and winnin’. I don’t
      snooze, so I don’t lose. I keep the pedal to the metal and the rubber on
      the road. I party hardy, and lunch time is crunch time. I’m hangin’ in,
      there ain’t no doubt, and I’m hangin’ tough, over and out."
