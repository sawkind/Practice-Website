# Project Notes

### First review items:

1. Always start an html with a __<pre><code><!DOCTYPE html></pre></code>__ declaration - your editor should do this for you, if not this won't be hard to do :)
2. Make sure all file names never have spaces between them (dash or underscore, dash is preferred)
3. Change the file names and their respective references in you file
4. Go through your files, and clean up the indentations and code blocks(see my note in your css sheet)
5. Use div's to organize other element blocks, and avoid adding only text directly (we'll discuss later)
6. See my comments about id's (make sure to cover the basics of html specifically block, inline level differences, attributes and attribute values - I can give you a brief overview, w3 schools has an excellent reference for each tag so you don't have to memorize it): (W3 School Tag Reference)[http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp].
7. Get used to commenting, actually, you may want to outline your document with comments before you even start building it (I'll show you what I mean later).

These are important and you should review them to make sure you understand them because they will trip you up at some point:
